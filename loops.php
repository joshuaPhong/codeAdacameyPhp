//Now you have the ability to repeat execution of code blocks as necessary in your PHP programs.
//
//Here is a summary of the topics covered in this lesson:
//
//    while loops execute only as long as their conditional evaluates to TRUE.
//doâ€¦while loops always execute at least once and then continue executing while their conditional is TRUE.
//    for loops contain 3 expressions and are frequently used to execute a code block a specific number of times.
//The first expression is executed prior to the first iteration.
//The second expression is evaluated prior to each iteration. If TRUE, the code block executes. Otherwise, the loop terminates.
//The third expression is evaluated after each iteration.
//    foreach loops are used for iterating over the elements of an array. The key and value of each element is available in the code block.
//    break is used to end execution of a loop early.
//    continue is used to end execution of a loop iteration early and continues to the next iteration.
