<?php
// Review
//Now you have the knowledge to create your own classes and objects in PHP using OOP! Take some time to review the concepts before moving on:
//
//Classes are defined using the class keyword.
//Functions defined within a class become methods and variables within the class are considered properties.
//There are three levels of visibility for class members:
//public (default) - accessible from outside of the class
//protected - only accessible within the class or its descendants
//private - only accessible within the defining class
//Members can be defined to be static.
//Static members are accessed using the Scope Resolution Operator (::).
//Classes are instantiated into objects using the new keyword.
//Members of an object are accessed using the Object Operator (->).
